    <h2>For you,</h2>

    <p>
      I just want to write a short letter about the moments we share right now in our lives. Everything moves so quickly. Time never stops spinning, and I realize how swiftly every second passes. There's nothing I want more than to
      experience every one of these moments with you.
      <br /><br />
      You're the first thing on my mind when I open my eyes in the morning, and sometimes even the reason I wake up from my dreams. Sometimes it's something specific you've said that's funny or sweet, or your occasional stern warnings. Your
      unique nature, your strong character, amazes me. You make every day meaningful because I know there will be opportunities to talk and laugh with you, if only it could always be like that.
      <br /><br />
      As I navigate through my days, you're the person I want to share the best and worst moments with. Although we've only shared a few moments together, it's the first time in my life I've felt such deep admiration for someone, to the
      point where I no longer think about seeking anyone else or returning to the past. Being with you is so beautiful, and every moment with you is a memory I'll cherish for the rest of my life.
      <br /><br />
      Believe me, even though I'm usually calm and indifferent, I've nearly lost control due to longing for you. I've felt pain from holding back thoughts of you, and I've felt deeply hurt from being away from you, even laughed at when I
      kept looking at your photos on the train seat last December, your chat status stories I always waited for, no day without seeing your IG. However, as time passes, I'm starting to get used to the loneliness and numbness. I even tried
      to set aside time for you, but I'm not as good as I hoped. There are many things I want to do, but I'm afraid to do them.
      <br /><br />
      I love you, but I keep my distance. A line from a drama you recommended to me ("Live on"). I believe that the more someone loves someone, the more secrets they hide. I feel unworthy of having you, and I feel I must succeed first
      before I can overcome the fear to express my feelings to you. My mind is filled with fear and doubt.
      <br /><br />
      I don't know how the story will unfold, but I will continue to live my life as usual. I will continue to love you, even though I don't know until when.
